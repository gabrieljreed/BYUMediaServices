# BYUMediaServices
A collection of scripts I wrote while working at BYU Media Services to speed production in AutoDesk Maya. These scripts use python to automate setting up individual shots for rendering and sending them to a render farm managed by Backburner, which ran overnight. The rendered shots were then automatically organized into a neat file system to then be composited in After Effects. The process is fully automated - starting the script in any file in the folder system will automatically detect and render all other shots in the same or sublevel directories. 

These scripts were used to send over 200 shots to the render farm in a single afternoon, a process which would have otherwise taken a team nearly an entire work week.
